    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello!        
         My current interests are technology, justice, and the intersection of both sectors.
         Currently, my areas of focus through my experiences include project management and strategic organization.
         I primarily code in C++, Python, and Java, where I am working on developing my knowledge in computer science through completing small projects!
         I thoroughly enjoy diving into creating efficient methods that lead to growth and progress.
         In the future, I hope to trailblaze innovative paths through technology and bring forth new inventions to help improve communities!</p>
