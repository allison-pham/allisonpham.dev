      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Allison and I'm currently a university student. My current
        interests are technology, justice, and the intersection of both sectors!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently, my areas of focus through my experiences include project management
        and strategic organization. I primarily code in C++, Python, and Java, where I
        am working on developing my knowledge in tech through the projects I create.
      </p>

      <p>
         I thoroughly enjoy diving into creating efficient methods that lead to growth
        and progress. In the future, I hope to trailblaze innovative paths through
        technology and bring forth new inventions to help improve communities!
      </p>

        Currently, my areas of focus through my experiences include project
        management, strategic organization, and data analysis to create succint
        strategies to lead a pathway to further developments and planning. I
        thoroughly enjoy diving into creating efficient methods that lead to growth
        and progress. In the future, I hope to trailblaze innovative paths through
        technology and bring forth new inventions to help improve communities!

        I'm a social justice advocate within my work in initiatives and research to
        create opportunity access of resources. To pursue my passions deeper, I
        serve on the board of directors for various organizations.​ I'm motivated by
        the focus of the intersections and impact of multiple identities. I'm
        interested about demonstrating these through writing, design, and social
        advocacy to create a cohesive manner to display each of these.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To further my career and interests, I hope to use the skills I have acquired
        to spearhead more projects focusing on the overlap of technology with
        humanities and justice.
      </p>

        Targeting technology, design, and justice to enhance innovation, growth, and learning! I'm a student, where I develop my knowledge in computer science, UI/UX, and advocacy through the projects I create.
        
        Currently, I focus on incorporating user-centered design (UCD) principles and prioritizing robust system integration. These are rooted in strategic, data-informed methodology that supports dynamic environments.
