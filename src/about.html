      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Allison and I'm currently a university student. My current
        interests are technology, justice, and the intersection of both sectors!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently, my areas of focus through my experiences include project management
        and strategic organization. I primarily code in C++, Python, and Java, where I
        am working on developing my knowledge in tech through the projects I create.
      </p>

      <p>
         I thoroughly enjoy diving into creating efficient methods that lead to growth
        and progress. In the future, I hope to trailblaze innovative paths through
        technology and bring forth new inventions to help improve communities!

        Currently, my areas of focus through my experiences include project
        management, strategic organization, and data analysis to create succint
        strategies to lead a pathway to further developments and planning. I
        thoroughly enjoy diving into creating efficient methods that lead to growth
        and progress. In the future, I hope to trailblaze innovative paths through
        technology and bring forth new inventions to help improve communities!

        I'm a social justice advocate within my work in initiatives and research to
        create opportunity access of resources. To pursue my passions deeper, I
        serve on the board of directors for various organizations.​ I'm motivated by
        the focus of the intersections and impact of multiple identities. I'm
        interested about demonstrating these through writing, design, and social
        advocacy to create a cohesive manner to display each of these.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To further my career and interests, I hope to use the skills I have acquired
        to spearhead more projects focusing on the overlap of technology with
        humanities and justice.
      </p>
