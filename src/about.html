  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My current interests are technology, justice, and the intersection of
    both sectors. Currently, my areas of focus through my experiences include
    project management and strategic organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    I primarily code in C++, Python, and Java, where I am working on developing
    my knowledge in computer science through completing small projects!
  </p>
  <p>
    I thoroughly enjoy diving into creating efficient methods that lead to
    growth and progress. In the future, I hope to trailblaze innovative paths
    through technology and bring forth new inventions to help improve
    communities!
